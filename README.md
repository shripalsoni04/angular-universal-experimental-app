# Sample Multipage App To Play with Angular Universal
This repository is only for experimenting with Angular Universal and learning it.

This application has three pages. Index, first and second page. This repository do not do anything dynamically. So in `index.js`, the code to generate static pages from routes is hardcoded for all the three routes. It is done specifically to keep the things simple for learning and referencing.

## Generate Static Pages from Angular App
- `npm run build-static-server`
- This command will generate static pages in `dist-server` folder. This can be served by any http server.
